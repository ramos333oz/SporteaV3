# Supabase Edge Functions Cleanup Report

## Executive Summary

This report documents the comprehensive cleanup of Supabase edge functions to match the local codebase cleanup and ensure only active functions remain deployed in the cloud environment. The cleanup focuses on maintaining the simplified vector-based recommendation system while removing deprecated and unused functions.

## Current Deployment Analysis

### Currently Deployed Functions (Before Cleanup)

| Function Name | Version | Status | Action Required |
|---------------|---------|--------|-----------------|
| `generate-match-embeddings` | 7 | ✅ Active | Keep - Used for match vector generation |
| `generate-user-embeddings` | 16 | ❌ Deprecated | Remove - Replace with v2 |
| `get-recommendations` | 21 | ❌ Unused | Remove - Old complex system |
| `analyze-user-clusters` | 1 | ❌ Unused | Remove - ML feature removed |
| `simplified-recommendations` | 10 | ✅ Active | Keep - Main recommendation engine |
| `process-embedding-queue` | 3 | ✅ Active | Keep - Vector processing queue |

### Missing Deployment

| Function Name | Status | Action Required |
|---------------|--------|-----------------|
| `generate-user-embeddings-v2` | ❌ Not Deployed | Deploy - Active version called by codebase |

## Codebase Analysis

### Active Function References Found

1. **`generate-user-embeddings-v2`** - Called by:
   - `process-embedding-queue/index.ts` (line 93)
   - `src/services/embeddingQueueService.js` (line 71)
   - `src/services/interactionService.js` (line 37)
   - Referenced in documentation as active version

2. **`generate-match-embeddings`** - Called by:
   - `generate_match_vectors.html` (line 122)
   - Used for batch processing match vectors

3. **`simplified-recommendations`** - Main recommendation function
   - Referenced in cleanup documentation
   - Core of the simplified vector system

4. **`process-embedding-queue`** - Queue processor
   - Calls other embedding functions
   - Critical for automatic vector updates

### Unused Function References

1. **`get-recommendations`** - No active references found
   - Old complex recommendation system
   - Replaced by simplified-recommendations

2. **`analyze-user-clusters`** - No active references found
   - Complex ML feature user wants removed
   - Not part of simplified system

## Critical Issue Identified

**Version Mismatch:** The codebase consistently calls `generate-user-embeddings-v2`, but only `generate-user-embeddings` (v16) is deployed. This creates a disconnect between the local code and deployed functions.

## System Status Verification

### Current System Behavior (Pre-Cleanup)
✅ **Recommendation System Working**: Despite version mismatch, the system is functional
- Similarity percentages displayed: 37%, 24%, 9%, 2%
- Vector-based recommendations active
- Mathematical calculations working correctly

### Console Log Analysis
```
[LOG] [Sportea Recommendation Service] Using simplified vector-based recommendation system for academic demonstration
[LOG] [Sportea Recommendation Service] Received simplified vector recommendations {count: 4, algorithm: simplified-vector-similarity, totalAnalyzed: 4, totalSimilar: 4}
[LOG] [Sportea Recommendation Service] User embedding generated successfully
```

**Key Finding**: The system appears to be using fallback mechanisms or the old `generate-user-embeddings` function is somehow compatible with v2 calls.

## Cleanup Action Plan

### Phase 1: Deploy Missing Function
```bash
# Deploy the missing v2 function
supabase functions deploy generate-user-embeddings-v2 --project-ref fcwwuiitsghknsvnsrxp
```

### Phase 2: Remove Deprecated Functions
```bash
# Remove old user embeddings function
supabase functions delete generate-user-embeddings --project-ref fcwwuiitsghknsvnsrxp

# Remove old recommendation system
supabase functions delete get-recommendations --project-ref fcwwuiitsghknsvnsrxp

# Remove ML clustering function
supabase functions delete analyze-user-clusters --project-ref fcwwuiitsghknsvnsrxp
```

### Phase 3: Verify Active Functions
```bash
# List remaining functions to confirm cleanup
supabase functions list --project-ref fcwwuiitsghknsvnsrxp
```

## Expected Final State

### Functions That Should Remain Deployed

| Function Name | Purpose | Status |
|---------------|---------|--------|
| `generate-match-embeddings` | Generate vectors for match characteristics | ✅ Keep |
| `generate-user-embeddings-v2` | Generate vectors for user preferences | ✅ Deploy |
| `simplified-recommendations` | Main recommendation engine using vector similarity | ✅ Keep |
| `process-embedding-queue` | Automatic vector update processing | ✅ Keep |

## System Architecture After Cleanup

```
User Preferences → generate-user-embeddings-v2 → User Vector
Match Data → generate-match-embeddings → Match Vector
Both Vectors → simplified-recommendations → Similarity Scores
Queue System → process-embedding-queue → Automatic Updates
```

## Mathematical Verification Maintained

The cleanup preserves the mathematically verifiable vector-based recommendation system:
- **User Preference Vectors**: 384-dimensional deterministic vectors
- **Match Characteristic Vectors**: 384-dimensional deterministic vectors  
- **Similarity Calculation**: Pure cosine similarity using PostgreSQL RPC
- **Performance Target**: <2ms response time maintained

## Testing Requirements

### Pre-Cleanup Testing
1. Document current system behavior
2. Test recommendation generation
3. Verify vector pipeline functionality

### Post-Cleanup Testing
1. Verify all 4 functions are deployed and active
2. Test recommendation system end-to-end
3. Verify vector generation pipeline
4. Confirm mathematical accuracy of similarity calculations
5. Test dual-screen methodology (localhost:3000/3001)

## Risk Mitigation

### Backup Strategy
- All local function code is preserved
- Database vectors remain intact
- Can redeploy functions if issues arise

### Rollback Plan
If issues occur after cleanup:
1. Redeploy removed functions temporarily
2. Investigate and fix issues
3. Re-attempt cleanup

## Prerequisites for Cleanup

1. **Supabase CLI Installation**
   ```bash
   npm install -g @supabase/cli
   ```

2. **Project Linking**
   ```bash
   supabase link --project-ref fcwwuiitsghknsvnsrxp
   ```

3. **Authentication**
   ```bash
   supabase login
   ```

## Manual Cleanup Instructions (CLI Not Available)

If Supabase CLI is not available, cleanup can be performed through the Supabase Dashboard:

### Step 1: Access Edge Functions
1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Select project: `fcwwuiitsghknsvnsrxp`
3. Navigate to Edge Functions section

### Step 2: Deploy Missing Function
1. Create new function: `generate-user-embeddings-v2`
2. Copy content from `supabase/functions/generate-user-embeddings-v2/index.ts`
3. Deploy the function

### Step 3: Remove Deprecated Functions
1. Delete `generate-user-embeddings` (old version)
2. Delete `get-recommendations` (old system)
3. Delete `analyze-user-clusters` (ML feature)

### Step 4: Verify Final State
Confirm only these 4 functions remain:
- `generate-match-embeddings`
- `generate-user-embeddings-v2`
- `simplified-recommendations`
- `process-embedding-queue`

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Only 4 active functions remain deployed
- [ ] No version confusion between local and deployed functions
- [ ] Recommendation system continues to work correctly
- [ ] Vector pipeline maintains mathematical accuracy
- [ ] Performance targets maintained (<2ms)
- [ ] All codebase references point to correct deployed functions

## Next Steps

1. Install Supabase CLI if not available
