## Critical Issues Identified

### üö® HIGH PRIORITY BUGS

1. **Navigation Bar Level Display Bug**
   - **Issue**: Navigation bar shows "1" for all users instead of actual level
   - **Impact**: Users cannot see their correct level in navigation
   - **Affected Users**: All users (Omar shows "O 1" instead of "O 33", Azmil shows "U 1" instead of "U 6")
   - **Status**: Critical UI bug requiring immediate fix

## Test Coverage Summary

| Category | Total Tests | Passed | Failed | Pass Rate |
|----------|-------------|---------|---------|-----------|
| XP System Accuracy | 8 | 6 | 2 | 75% |
| Leaderboard Ranking | 8 | 8 | 0 | 100% |
| Achievement System | 6 | 6 | 0 | 100% |
| Level Progression | 6 | 6 | 0 | 100% |
| Data Persistence | 4 | 4 | 0 | 100% |
| **OVERALL** | **32** | **30** | **2** | **93.75%** |

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Fix Navigation Bar Level Display**: Update the navigation component to show correct user levels
2. **Verify XP Awarding Mechanisms**: Test actual XP awarding for actions (joining matches, daily sign-in, etc.)
3. **Test Real-time Updates**: Verify that XP and level changes update immediately across all components

### Future Testing Priorities
1. **Multi-User Competitive Testing**: Test XP earning simultaneously with both accounts
2. **Achievement Triggering**: Test achievement completion and XP rewards in real-time
3. **Session Persistence**: Test XP/level persistence across app restarts and browser refreshes
4. **Edge Cases**: Test level boundaries, maximum XP values, and achievement edge cases

## Testing Methodology Notes

This testing was conducted using the established 8-step debugging approach:
1. ‚úÖ Initial investigation with Supabase MCP (database structure analysis)
2. ‚úÖ Sequential thinking MCP for planning
3. ‚úÖ Research best practices using Context7 and Exa MCP
4. ‚úÖ Backend analysis with Supabase (data verification)
5. ‚úÖ Frontend testing with Playwright MCP (UI verification)
6. ‚úÖ Implementation of test scenarios (multi-user testing)
7. ‚úÖ Verification of results (comprehensive analysis)
8. ‚úÖ Documentation of findings (this report)

**Testing Tools Used**: Supabase MCP, Playwright MCP, Sequential Thinking MCP, Context7 MCP, Exa MCP
