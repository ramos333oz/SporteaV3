# Enhanced Social Features Implementation Plan for Sportea

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive plan to enhance Sportea's social features, making the app more connective and interactive. Based on research of successful sports apps and social gaming platforms, we propose implementing friend invitation systems, real-time messaging, and enhanced social engagement features.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Friendship System ‚úÖ
Sportea already has a robust friendship system:
- Friend requests (send/receive/accept/decline)
- Friend lists with management capabilities
- Blocking functionality
- User search by email
- Notification system for friend requests

### Current Gaps üîç
- No friend invitation to matches
- No real-time chat/messaging
- Limited social engagement features
- No team/group formation tools
- No social activity feeds

## Proposed Features

### 1. Friend Invitation to Matches üéØ **HIGH PRIORITY**

#### Feature Description
Allow match hosts to directly invite friends to their hosted matches, streamlining the process of building teams with trusted players.

#### Implementation Details
- **UI Components**: 
  - "Invite Friends" button in match creation/editing
  - Friend selection modal with search and filter
  - Invitation status tracking
- **Backend**: 
  - New `match_invitations` table
  - Invitation notification system
  - Auto-join vs request-to-join options

#### User Flow
1. Host creates/edits a match
2. Host clicks "Invite Friends" 
3. Host selects friends from list
4. Friends receive notifications
5. Friends can accept/decline invitations
6. Accepted invitations auto-join or create join requests

#### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE match_invitations (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  match_id UUID REFERENCES matches(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  inviter_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  invitee_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending', -- 'pending', 'accepted', 'declined'
  message TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now(),
  responded_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  UNIQUE(match_id, invitee_id)
);
```

### 2. Real-Time Messaging System üí¨ **HIGH PRIORITY**
