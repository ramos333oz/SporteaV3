- Achievement system: 3 achievements unlocked without errors
- Database operations: All CRUD operations completed successfully

## Task 2: Profile Page Facility Cleanup ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIALLY COMPLETED

### Implementation Status: **PENDING SUPABASE CONNECTION**

| Component | Action Required | Status | Notes |
|-----------|----------------|---------|-------|
| **Database Verification** | Check if facility `d3fef621-dcc4-4510-885b-3af583ee02eb` exists | ‚ö†Ô∏è PENDING | Supabase tools connection issues |
| **User Profile Cleanup** | Remove facility from all user profiles | ‚ö†Ô∏è PENDING | Requires database access |
| **Frontend Code Review** | Check for hardcoded facility references | ‚úÖ COMPLETED | No hardcoded references found |

### Analysis Completed

**‚úÖ Codebase Analysis:**
- Examined `src/pages/Profile.jsx` for hardcoded facility references
- Used codebase-retrieval to search for facility ID across all files
- Confirmed facility ID is not hardcoded in frontend components
- Identified that facility references are stored in user profile data

**‚ö†Ô∏è Pending Actions:**
- Database query to verify facility existence
- Cleanup of orphaned facility references in user profiles
- System-wide removal of non-existent facility ID

## Task 3: Match Details Page Fixes ‚úÖ COMPLETED

### Implementation Status: **COMPLETE SUCCESS**

| Issue | Root Cause | Fix Applied | Status |
|-------|------------|-------------|---------|
| **Random placeholder text** | UUID instead of sport name | Updated to use sportName/sportDisplayName | ‚úÖ FIXED |
| **Description text overflow** | Missing CSS styling | Added comprehensive TextField styling | ‚úÖ FIXED |
| **Unwanted "Court A1" text** | Automatic court name appending | Removed auto-appending logic | ‚úÖ FIXED |
| **Sport UUID in helper text** | UUID in participant requirement | Updated to use proper sport name | ‚úÖ FIXED |
| **Input field cleaning** | No validation for unwanted text | Added cleaning functions | ‚úÖ FIXED |

### Technical Implementation

**‚úÖ Files Modified:**
- `src/pages/Host/MatchDetails.jsx` - Fixed sport name display and input styling
- `src/services/supabase.js` - Removed automatic court name appending

**‚úÖ Key Improvements:**
1. **Sport Name Display:** Replaced UUIDs with proper sport names throughout form
2. **Description Styling:** Fixed text overflow with proper CSS styling
3. **Court Name Prevention:** Eliminated automatic "Court A1" text appending
4. **Input Cleaning:** Added robust cleaning functions for titles and descriptions
5. **User Experience:** Significantly improved form clarity and usability

**‚úÖ Testing Verification:**
- Created test match: "Test Match - MatchDetails Fixes Football"
- Verified sport name displays as "Football" instead of UUID
- Confirmed description field handles long text with proper wrapping
- Validated no "Court A1" text appears automatically
- Tested input cleaning functions work correctly
