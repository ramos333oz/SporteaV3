## Adaptive Threshold Learning Content Moderation System

### Overview

This guide explains how to use and monitor the new Adaptive Threshold Learning system in SporteaV3's content moderation dashboard. The system automatically learns from your moderation decisions to improve accuracy and reduce false positives while maintaining strict educational environment standards.

## What is Adaptive Threshold Learning?

The Adaptive Threshold Learning system observes your approval and rejection decisions to automatically adjust moderation thresholds. When you approve content that was flagged as risky, the system learns that similar content should be less likely to be flagged in the future. This reduces your workload while maintaining safety standards.

### Key Benefits

- **Reduced False Positives**: Fewer legitimate sports content incorrectly flagged
- **Improved Accuracy**: Better recognition of competitive sports language vs. inappropriate content
- **Cultural Adaptation**: Learns Malaysian sports culture and mixed-language patterns
- **Maintained Safety**: Zero tolerance for explicit content and harassment remains unchanged
- **Reduced Workload**: Fewer items requiring manual review over time

## Getting Started

### Accessing the Enhanced Dashboard

1. **Login to Admin Dashboard**
   - Navigate to your SporteaV3 admin panel
   - Use your admin credentials to log in
   - Select "Content Moderation" from the sidebar

2. **New Dashboard Features**
   - **Adaptive Learning Metrics**: Real-time learning performance display
   - **Threshold History**: View of recent threshold adjustments
   - **Context Information**: Shows which learning context applies to each item

**Solution**:
1. Immediately reject the content
2. Check safety bounds are active
3. Review recent threshold changes
4. Report to technical team for investigation

### Issue: Learning Not Responding

**Symptoms**: No threshold adjustments despite feedback

**Solution**:
1. Verify adaptive learning is enabled
2. Check minimum feedback threshold reached
3. Ensure decisions are consistent
4. Review learning parameters with technical team

**Q: Can I disable adaptive learning for specific contexts?**
A: Yes, through the advanced settings panel or by contacting technical support.

**Q: What happens if I make a mistake in my decision?**
A: The system uses multiple signals and won't overreact to single decisions. Consistent patterns matter more.

**Q: How do I know if the system is learning correctly?**
A: Monitor the adaptive learning metrics panel and watch for reduced false positives over time.

This adaptive learning system is designed to make your moderation work more efficient while maintaining the highest standards for student safety and educational appropriateness.
