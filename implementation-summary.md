# Sportea Recommendation System - Implementation Summary

## Background
The original recommendation system used embedding vectors to compute similarity between users and matches. This created complexity, maintenance issues, and potential points of failure in the system.

## Solution: Simplified Recommendation System

We implemented a simplified recommendation system with the following design principles:

1. **No Embeddings**: Directly compare user preferences with match attributes
2. **Transparent Scoring**: Clear explanation of why a match is recommended
3. **Multi-factor Recommendations**: Combine direct preference matching, collaborative filtering, and activity-based scoring
4. **Resilient Implementation**: Multiple implementation methods with fallbacks

## Implementation Approaches

### 1. Edge Function (`get-recommendations-light`)

Created a simplified edge function that:
- Directly queries user preferences and matches from the database
- Applies a weighted scoring algorithm:
  - 60% weight: Direct preference matching (sports, skill level, location, availability)
  - 30% weight: Collaborative filtering (based on similar users' activities)
  - 10% weight: Activity-based scoring (popularity, recency)
- Provides explanations for each recommendation
- Returns structured recommendations with stats

### 2. Direct Database Query (Frontend)

Implemented the same algorithm directly in the frontend service that:
- Works as a fallback when the edge function is unavailable
- Performs the same queries and calculations
- Has identical scoring logic and output format
- Provides resilience in case of edge function issues

### 3. Fallback Mechanism (Existing)

Retained the existing fallback mechanism that:
- Returns basic recommendations when all other methods fail
- Ensures users always see some content

## Scoring Algorithm

The scoring algorithm evaluates matches across three dimensions:

1. **Direct Preference Matching (60% weight)**
   - Sport preference match: +30 points
   - Skill level exact match: +15 points
   - Skill level adjacent match: +5 points
   - Location preference match: +10 points
   - Availability (day of week) match: +5 points

2. **Collaborative Filtering (30% weight)**
   - Matches that similar users participated in: +30 points

3. **Activity-based Scoring (10% weight)**
   - Popular matches (>50% full): +5 points
   - Somewhat popular matches (>25% full): +3 points
   - Recently created matches (<3 days old): +5 points

Each recommendation includes an explanation string that details why it was recommended to the user.

## Testing Approach

1. **Test Script (`test-simplified-light.js`)**
   - Tests the edge function directly
   - Authenticates as a test user
   - Displays detailed results with explanation

2. **Direct Test (`direct-test.js`)**
   - Tests the database query implementation directly
   - Bypasses the edge function
   - Shows detailed diagnostic information

## Configuration

The recommendation service can be configured with the following flags:
- `USE_SIMPLIFIED_ENDPOINT`: Whether to use the simplified recommendation endpoint
- `USE_DIRECT_DB_QUERY`: Whether to use the direct database query approach
- `USE_DIAGNOSTIC_ENDPOINT`: Whether to use the diagnostic endpoint (for debugging)

## Benefits

1. **Simplicity**: The algorithm is easy to understand and debug
2. **Performance**: Reduced computation overhead by eliminating vector operations
3. **Maintainability**: Code is self-contained and doesn't depend on external embedding services
4. **Transparency**: Recommendations include explanations for why they are shown
5. **Resilience**: Multiple fallback mechanisms ensure recommendations are always available

## Next Steps

1. Complete testing with real user data
2. Monitor performance and adjust weights if needed
3. Remove duplicate/test files once the new system is confirmed stable
4. Add additional preference factors to the scoring algorithm as needed
5. Implement caching for better performance
