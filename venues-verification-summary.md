# Venues Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the venues feature for the sports application, which allows users to browse venues on a map view, filter by sport, and select venues when creating matches.

## Database Configuration

We successfully implemented the following database changes:

1. Ensured the `locations` table has all required fields:
   - `id` (UUID)
   - `name` (text)
   - `campus` (text)
   - `address` (text)
   - `coordinates` (JSONB)
   - `supported_sports` (UUID array)
   - `image_url` (text)
   - `is_verified` (boolean)

2. Applied migrations to:
   - Add missing sports (Rugby, Hockey, Frisbee, Squash)
   - Populate the locations table with venue data for UiTM campus
   - Associate each venue with the appropriate sports via `supported_sports`

3. Added all required venues including:
   - Football/Rugby fields: Padang Pusat Sukan UiTM
   - Basketball courts: Court Pusat Sukan A, Court Pusat Sukan B
   - Futsal courts: Court Pusat Sukan A/B, Court Perindu A/B/C
   - Volleyball courts: Court Pusat Sukan A/B, Court Perindu A/B
   - Frisbee/Hockey field: Padang Hoki Pusat Sukan
   - Tennis courts: Court Budisiswa A/B/C/D, Court Pusat Sukan A/B/C/D
