ALWAYS USE PLAYWRIGHT MCP TO BROWSE THE APP AND SEE YOURSELF TO GAIN CONTEXT OF WHATS HAPPENING BEFORE IMPLEMENTING OR WHILE OR AFTER IMPLEMENTING A NEW FEATURES. CHECK OUT THE LOGS IF THERES ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION NEEDED IF ENCOUNTERED ERRORS OR BUGS. 

ALWAYS PRIORITIZE TO USE SUPABASE MCP WHENEVER THERE IS BUGS TO GAIN MORE CONTEXT OF THE BACKEND.

BEFORE IMPLEMENTATION, ALWAYS STUDY BEST PRACTICES AND CODE DOCUMENTATIONS USING CONEXT7 AND EXA MCP AND UR OWN WEB SEARCH TO FETCH LATEST DOCUMENTATIONS AND BEST PRACTICES, FIND THE ONE THAT ARE MOST RELATABLE AND FOLLOW PROFESSIONAL GUIDELINES, THINK LIKE A SOFTWARE ENGINEER AND PRODUCT MANAGER.

MAKE SURE WHEN THERES AN ERROR OR A NEED FOR NEW IMPLEMENTATION, USE SEQUENTIAL THINKING MCP.
