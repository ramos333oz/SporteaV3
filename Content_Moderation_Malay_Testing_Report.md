## Category Performance Analysis

### Strong Performance (≥70% Pass Rate)
- **Clean Content**: 100% (2/2) - System correctly identifies appropriate content
- **Multiple Profanity**: 100% (1/1) - Detects severe violations effectively
- **Sexual Content**: 100% (1/1) - Identifies explicit sexual references

### Moderate Performance (50-69% Pass Rate)
- **Basic Malay Profanity**: 50% (1/2) - Inconsistent detection of common swear words

### Poor Performance (<50% Pass Rate)
- **Threatening Language**: 0% (0/1) - Failed to detect violent threats
- **Mixed Language**: 0% (0/1) - Struggles with bilingual inappropriate content
- **Sports Competitive**: 0% (0/1) - No sports context whitelisting in fallback
- **Discriminatory Content**: 0% (0/1) - Missed racial discrimination
- **Mild Profanity**: 0% (0/1) - Underestimates subtle inappropriate content
- **Excessive Caps**: 0% (0/1) - Caps detection not working properly
- **Drug References**: 0% (0/1) - No drug-related keyword detection
- **Religious Inappropriate**: 0% (0/1) - Missed religious profanity

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Insufficient Malay Keyword Coverage
**Problem**: The fallback system lacks comprehensive Malay inappropriate content detection.
- Missing drug-related terms: "ganja" (marijuana)
- Missing discriminatory language patterns
- Incomplete threatening language detection

### 2. Threshold Calibration Issues
**Problem**: Risk level thresholds may be too conservative.
- Single Malay profanity words only trigger "low" risk instead of "medium"
- Threatening language ("bunuh" = kill) only scores 0.4 instead of ≥0.8 for high risk

### 3. Context Awareness Gaps
**Problem**: No sports context whitelisting in fallback system.
- Competitive terms like "crush" should be acceptable in sports context
- System lacks domain-specific intelligence

### 4. Technical Detection Failures
**Problem**: Basic detection mechanisms not working properly.
- Excessive capitalization detection failed
- Mixed language content scoring incorrectly

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)
1. **Enhance Malay Keyword Database**
   - Add comprehensive drug-related terms
   - Include discriminatory language patterns
   - Expand threatening language detection

2. **Recalibrate Risk Thresholds**
   - Lower thresholds for single profanity detection
   - Increase weights for threatening language
   - Adjust scoring for mixed-language content

3. **Fix Technical Issues**
   - Repair excessive capitalization detection
   - Improve mixed-language content handling

### Medium-Term Improvements
1. **Implement Sports Context Whitelisting**
   - Add competitive terms whitelist for sports content
   - Implement domain-aware content analysis

2. **Enhanced ML Integration**
   - Ensure ML edge function is primary moderation method
   - Use fallback system only for emergency situations

### Long-Term Strategy
1. **Continuous Learning System**
   - Implement feedback loop for improving detection
   - Regular updates to keyword databases
   - Community reporting integration

## Conclusion

The testing reveals that while the content moderation service can detect severe violations (strong profanity, sexual content), it has significant gaps in Malay language content detection. The **40% pass rate** indicates that the fallback system is insufficient for production use with Malay content.

**Critical Recommendation**: The ML-powered edge function with comprehensive Malay language support should be the primary moderation system, with the fallback system serving only as an emergency backup after significant improvements.

### Success Criteria for Future Testing
- **Target Pass Rate**: ≥70% for Malay content detection
- **High-Risk Detection**: 100% for threatening and discriminatory content
- **False Positive Rate**: <10% for clean sports content
