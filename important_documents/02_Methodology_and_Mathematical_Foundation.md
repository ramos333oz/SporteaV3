# Methodology and Mathematical Foundation

## Abstract

This document provides a comprehensive mathematical foundation for our vector-based recommendation system, detailing the theoretical principles, algorithmic approaches, and mathematical formulations that enable explainable and verifiable recommendation percentages.

## 1. Theoretical Foundation

### 1.1 Vector Space Model for User Preferences

#### Mathematical Representation

In our system, user preferences are represented as vectors in a high-dimensional space:

```
User Preference Vector: u ∈ ℝ^d
where d = 384 (dimensions)
```

Each dimension captures a specific aspect of semantic meaning derived from user preference text through neural embedding techniques.

#### Preference Text to Vector Transformation

The transformation process follows this mathematical pipeline:

```
T: P → V
where:
P = {preference text} ∈ String
V = {vector representation} ∈ ℝ^384
```

**Example Transformation:**
```
Input Text: "Football beginner, Monday evenings, casual play"
Tokenization: [football, beginner, monday, evenings, casual, play]
Embedding: f(tokens) → [0.1, 0.3, -0.2, 0.8, ..., 0.4] ∈ ℝ^384
```

### 1.2 Semantic Embedding Theory

#### Distributional Hypothesis

Our approach is grounded in the distributional hypothesis (Harris, 1954):
> "Words that occur in similar contexts tend to have similar meanings"

Extended to user preferences:
> "Users with similar preference expressions tend to have similar interests"

#### Neural Embedding Mathematics

The Sentence Transformer model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) implements:

```
E: S → ℝ^d
where:
S = sentence/preference text
d = 384 dimensions
E = embedding function learned through transformer architecture
```

The embedding function E is learned through:
1. **Self-attention mechanisms** capturing contextual relationships
2. **Multi-layer transformations** extracting hierarchical features
3. **Contrastive learning** optimizing semantic similarity preservation

## 2. Similarity Calculation Mathematics

### 2.1 Cosine Similarity Formula

The core similarity calculation uses cosine similarity:

```
similarity(u, v) = cos(θ) = (u · v) / (||u|| × ||v||)

where:
u · v = Σ(i=1 to d) u_i × v_i  (dot product)
||u|| = √(Σ(i=1 to d) u_i²)     (Euclidean norm)
||v|| = √(Σ(i=1 to d) v_i²)     (Euclidean norm)
```

#### Mathematical Properties

1. **Range**: similarity(u, v) ∈ [-1, 1]
2. **Symmetry**: similarity(u, v) = similarity(v, u)
3. **Self-similarity**: similarity(u, u) = 1
4. **Orthogonality**: similarity(u, v) = 0 when u ⊥ v

### 2.2 Percentage Conversion

The similarity score is converted to a user-friendly percentage:

```
percentage = max(0, similarity(u, v)) × 100

Rationale for max(0, ·):
- Negative similarities indicate opposing preferences
- For recommendation purposes, we treat these as 0% compatibility
- Maintains intuitive 0-100% scale for users
```

### 2.3 Geometric Interpretation

#### Vector Angle Relationship

Cosine similarity measures the angle between vectors in high-dimensional space:

```
θ = arccos(similarity(u, v))

Interpretation:
θ = 0°   → similarity = 1.0  → 100% match (identical preferences)
θ = 45°  → similarity = 0.71 → 71% match (good compatibility)
θ = 90°  → similarity = 0.0  → 0% match (orthogonal preferences)
θ = 180° → similarity = -1.0 → 0% match (opposite preferences)
```

## 3. Algorithmic Methodology

### 3.1 Vector Generation Algorithm

```
Algorithm 1: User Preference Vector Generation
Input: User preference data P = {sports, times, locations, style, demographics}
Output: 384-dimensional vector v ∈ ℝ^384

1. text_description ← format_preferences(P)
   // Example: "Football beginner, Monday evenings, casual play, Engineering faculty"

2. tokens ← tokenize(text_description)
   // Sentence-level tokenization preserving semantic context

3. v ← sentence_transformer.encode(tokens)
   // Neural embedding via all-MiniLM-L6-v2

4. normalize(v)  // Optional: L2 normalization for consistent magnitude
   
5. return v
```

### 3.2 Similarity Search Algorithm

```
Algorithm 2: HNSW-Based Similarity Search
Input: Query vector q ∈ ℝ^384, threshold τ, limit k
Output: Top-k similar vectors with similarity ≥ τ

1. candidates ← hnsw_search(q, k × 2)  // Over-fetch for filtering
   // O(log n) complexity due to hierarchical navigation

2. similarities ← []
3. for each candidate c in candidates:
4.    sim ← cosine_similarity(q, c)
5.    if sim ≥ τ:
6.       similarities.append((c, sim))

7. sort similarities by sim descending
8. return top k similarities
```

### 3.3 Recommendation Score Calculation

```
Algorithm 3: Recommendation Percentage Calculation
Input: User vector u, Target vector t
Output: Recommendation percentage p ∈ [0, 100]

1. similarity ← cosine_similarity(u, t)
   // Core mathematical calculation

2. percentage ← max(0, similarity) × 100
   // Convert to 0-100% scale

3. explanation ← generate_explanation(percentage)
   // Human-readable explanation

4. return {
     score: similarity,
     percentage: percentage,
     explanation: explanation,
     calculation_method: "cosine_similarity"
   }
```

## 4. Mathematical Validation

### 4.1 Theoretical Guarantees

#### Metric Properties
Cosine similarity satisfies key mathematical properties:

1. **Non-negativity**: similarity(u, v) ≥ -1
2. **Symmetry**: similarity(u, v) = similarity(v, u)
3. **Triangle Inequality**: For normalized vectors, satisfies modified triangle inequality
4. **Consistency**: Identical inputs always produce identical outputs

#### Computational Complexity
- **Vector Generation**: O(n) where n = text length
- **Similarity Calculation**: O(d) where d = 384 dimensions
- **HNSW Search**: O(log N) where N = database size

### 4.2 Empirical Validation Methods

#### Test Cases for Mathematical Accuracy

```
Test Case 1: Identical Preferences
Input: u = v = [0.1, 0.3, -0.2, ...]
Expected: similarity(u, v) = 1.0, percentage = 100%

Test Case 2: Orthogonal Preferences  
Input: u = [1, 0, 0, ...], v = [0, 1, 0, ...]
Expected: similarity(u, v) = 0.0, percentage = 0%

Test Case 3: Opposite Preferences
Input: u = [1, 2, 3, ...], v = [-1, -2, -3, ...]
Expected: similarity(u, v) = -1.0, percentage = 0%
```

#### Consistency Verification

```
Property: Deterministic Results
For any user u and target t:
∀ calls to similarity(u, t) → same result

Property: Monotonicity
If similarity(u, v₁) > similarity(u, v₂)
Then percentage(u, v₁) > percentage(u, v₂)
```

## 5. Comparison with Multi-Factor Approaches

### 5.1 Traditional Multi-Factor Formula

```
Traditional Approach:
score = Σ(i=1 to n) w_i × f_i(user, target)

where:
w_i = weight for factor i (Σw_i = 1)
f_i = scoring function for factor i
n = number of factors

Example:
score = 0.4×vector_sim + 0.2×behavior + 0.2×skill + 0.1×location + 0.1×time
```

### 5.2 Problems with Multi-Factor Approaches

#### Mathematical Issues
1. **Weight Arbitrariness**: No theoretical justification for specific weights
2. **Factor Independence Assumption**: Assumes factors are orthogonal (often false)
3. **Scale Inconsistency**: Different factors may have different value ranges
4. **Non-linear Interactions**: Linear combination ignores factor interactions

#### Explainability Issues
1. **Black Box Effect**: Users cannot trace how final score is calculated
2. **Weight Sensitivity**: Small weight changes can dramatically affect results
3. **Factor Attribution**: Difficult to determine which factors drive recommendations

### 5.3 Vector Approach Advantages

#### Mathematical Rigor
1. **Single Metric**: One well-defined mathematical operation
2. **Theoretical Foundation**: Grounded in established vector space theory
3. **Consistent Scale**: Always produces values in [-1, 1] range
4. **Geometric Interpretation**: Clear meaning in high-dimensional space

#### Explainability Benefits
1. **Complete Traceability**: Every calculation step is verifiable
2. **Intuitive Meaning**: Percentage directly reflects preference similarity
3. **Consistent Interpretation**: 75% always means same level of compatibility
4. **Academic Defensibility**: Based on established mathematical principles
